## About the project (How I created my web portfolio)

This project is about my introduction of myself and my portfolio. The purpose is to demonstrate the skills that I learn from the Web Development course. Basically, there are three web languages: HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The framework is Bootstrap which is a modern and popular framework nowadays. Here are the steps of how I create my web portfolio.

 1. Review all my mockups and list down the structures, materials, images, and components.
 2. Resize all images to a suitable resolution in Photoshop.
 3. Code the HTML of all pages with Bootstrap and modify some details.
 4. Add my customized CSS, style.css, to change the color and some layout details.
 5. Code the auto-play carousel of my photo album with jQuery and my CSS.
 6. Verify my code.
 7. Upload to GitHub.


### Challenges Faced

 1. Customized CSS
  - Change the color, size, and spacing of elemens

 2. Auto-play Carousel
  - Code the carousel from scratch

 3. Responsive Image Resolution
  - Determine the image resolution when changing browser width


### Overcoming Challeges

 1. Customized CSS
  - I copied the CSS Variable from Bootstrap, pasted, and revised the color in my CSS.
  - For other elements outside the CSS Variables, I added the new class for them.

 2. Auto-play Carousel
  - First, I searched for the carousel on w3scholl and figured out the logic of coding the carousel.
  - Then, I searched for the jquery reference to find the correspondent code to write the complete function of the carousel.
  - After I completed the carousel, I used the setInterval code to make an auto-play function and completed the auto-play carousel.

 3. Responsive Image Resolution
  - I searched for the breakpoint on the Internet and Bootstrap first.
  - Based on the breakpoints, I calculated the image widths for each breakpoint.
  - After listing down all the sizes I needed, I resized the images with Photoshop.
  - Then, I started to code the HTML with `<picture>` code.

## What I learned

During this project, I've learned how to search for information on relevant resources and troubleshoot my failed code. When I was stuck, I would first think of the problem and go back to see the original code to figure out the differences between my code and the original code. Then, I would keep trying a different way to code and testing until it worked. If there was nothing I could do, I would search for another code logic from the Internet. After I found a suitable substitute code, I would adapt it to my code to see whether it worked.

The other thing that I learned was time management. Since this project was about my portfolio, there were many elements and pages to code. As a result, I learned how to separate the chunks of work into a schedule and follow it. Once I was behind on the schedule, I would adjust the schedule to make it reasonable or speed up coding.

To summarize, this project did not only help me to demonstrate my work but also improved my coding and troubleshooting skills and the ability to manage a web project.
